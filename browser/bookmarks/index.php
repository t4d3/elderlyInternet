	Often times people want quick access to a website.  Bookmarks are are like buttons that are saved into the browser, so you can access those websites more easily.
</p>
<p>
	Lets start with a website you might use often, like <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/">The Huffington Post</a>.  Go ahead and click the link, look around, and then press the <b>back</b> button.
</p>
<p>
	After you click that link again, look for the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/">star</a> button at the top of your browser.  It may look like this: <img id="bookmark" src="/img/bookmark.jpg" alt="bookmark for Huffington Post"></a>
