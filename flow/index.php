	<h1>News Papers</h1>
	<p>
		Starting off, it is important to know that if you are looking at a web page with articles, it can be very similar to news papers. You may see images within the article, like the one shown here, and even videos. Topics, or news stories are very similar in the way they are formatted, so reading articles will be a very familiar feeling for the avid news paper reader.
	</p>
	<p>
		Another thing to note is that there are things called "links", that link you to "web pages" which are like buttons to turn the page of a news paper. We will learn more about those links later, but for now, click the "next" button at the bottom on the page.
