	<h1>Navigation</h1>
	<p>Navigating through the internet is, again, very similar to using a newspaper. Often times there will be adds on the side, which you can ignore. Often times though, there will be a navigation bar, that uses links to get you around the website you are visiting. These navigation links will almost <strong>always</strong> stay within the website, but take you to a different page on that website.</p>
