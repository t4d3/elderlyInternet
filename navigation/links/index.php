	<h1>Links</h1>
	<p>
		Links are one of the most important functions of the internet. Links are buttons that are like taking to different pages on a website, or different websites all together. For example, when you clicked the "next" button on the last page, it took you to a different page in our newspaper.
	</p>
	<h1>What do Links look like?</h1>
	<p>
		Links can look like almost anything.  Here are some examples of what different links can look like:
		<ul>
			<li><a href="/links" title="To Nowhere">Example 1</a></li>
			<li><button type="button" onclick="alert('Just click OK to get rid of this message.')">Example 2</button></li>
			<li><a href="/links" title="To Nowhere"><img id="exampleLink" src="/img/exampleButton.png" alt="This is Example 3"></a></li>
		</ul>
		As we can see!
