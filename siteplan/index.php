<h1>Target Audience</h1>
<p>Well, my website will be about teaching people to use the internet, so my best target audience will be old people, that don't know a lot about running jokes on the internet. It will focus on the basics, and have a (slightly) larger than normal font, with references to something more familiar, like a news paper or something that they can relate to more.</p>

<h1>Persona</h1>
<p>Dale is a wonderful man, that after around 72 years of shopping the old fashioned 
   way, lost the use of his legs... He has set out to try and tackle online shopping, 
   so he needs some pointers on how to navigate stores, and fill out online forms, so 
   he can become an online shopper. Dale was given this website from a good friend, 
   and will try it out. This means that the website should be easy to read for Dale, 
   so he can find out how to make online purchases, and maybe a video on how to navigate 
   through the web in general.</p>
<p>Elena, is a grandmother (soon to be great-grandmother!) who is looking 
   to get into facebook, so she can catch up with her grandchildren. Sadly 
   she doesn't understand how links work, or how a "wall" works, in Facebook.  
   She also is afraid to click on anything, because she can easily become lost 
   on the world wide web.</P>
<p>Jason, is the third person who might be on the website looking into 
   teaching their parents how to use the internet. Because of this, I would 
   have to get the attention of a person skimming for help. This means that 
   the main page must be clear in its purpose, and advertise help/live support 
   for elderly, and simple enough to earn the trust of Jason, and refer this 
   site to his parents.</p>

<h1>Content List</h1>
<p>Because my site is a guide/tutorial for people, it will be broken 
up into different topics, such as</p>
<ul>
   <li>General navigation</li>
   <li>Different featers in websites (social media, email, or payment fields)</li>
   <li>Options within a browser (bookmarks, and navigation)</li>
   <li>How things flow on websites</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully I can make things flow, so that the website can progress, like a tutorial.</p>
